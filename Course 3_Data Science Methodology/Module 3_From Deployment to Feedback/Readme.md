Stakeholders, including the solution owner, marketing staff, application developers, and IT administration evaluate the model and contribute feedback.
During the Deployment stage, data scientists release the data model to a targeted group of stakeholders.
Stakeholder and user feedback help assess the model's performance and impact during the Feedback stage.
The model's value depends on iteration; that is, how successfully the data model incorporates user feedback.
