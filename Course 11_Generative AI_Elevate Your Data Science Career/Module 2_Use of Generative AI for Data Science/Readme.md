Important Note: Generative AI Tool Access Update
Generative AI tools like Akkio (https://www.akkio.com/) and Columns AI (https://column) featured in the videos are currently not offering a free trial. 
Akkio has disabled Google sign-up and ended its free trial, while Columns AI now requires credit card details to initiate one. used in the videos are currently not offering free trial .
As an alternative, Zoho Analytics will be used in the upcoming Hands-on Lab. It offers comparable features such as data upload, AI-powered insights through Zia, interactive charts, and dashboard sharing.  It provides a 15-day free trial of premium features without requiring a credit card. If extended access is needed, a new account can be created.
