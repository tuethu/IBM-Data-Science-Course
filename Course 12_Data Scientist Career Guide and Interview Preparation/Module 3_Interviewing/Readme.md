- Self introduction and reason get started with Data Sciene
- Why we should use R or Python over the other (difference, use case, merit and demerit of each programming language)
- Box Plot definition and use case
- Difference between supervised and unsupervised leaning, use case
- If a model has 90% accuracy on training set but only 50% accuracy on test set, what is the problem? (overfitting, potential causes, ways to solve problem)
- Danger of underfitting (model could  not take advantage of data, perform poorly on training and test)
- What metric should be used to evaluable an unbalanced data set for classification if false negative does not matter (precision is the main one, other methods could be recall, F score metric definition, meaning)

- If a model always outputs the number four, what would be the variance?
Variance measures how far values deviate from their mean.
If a model always outputs the number 4, no matter what the input is, then all predictions are identical. The variance is zero because the model’s output never changes.

- If a linear system of 3 equations and 2 unknowns, how would we approximately solve the system?
The system is usually overdetermined. 
(When there are “too many” equations, they usually don’t all agree, so there is no exact solution that satisfies every equation simultaneously.)
The standard way to do this is: Use the Least Squares Method to finds the values of the two unknowns that minimize the total error between the left‑hand and right‑hand sides of the equations

Other possible solutions: 
Optimization techniques or Projection onto the closest consistent solution

- A project that you're very proud of.And what was your individual contribution to that?

- Technical challenges or things that you felt were hard to solve?
-  Any specific library that you remember when using R?
Tidyverse for data cleaning, ggplot to visualize 
- Are you familiar with SQL?
- The differences between inner and outer join
![SQL Joins](https://github.com/tuethu/IBM-Data-Science-Course/blob/main/Course%2012_Data%20Scientist%20Career%20Guide%20and%20Interview%20Preparation/Media/SQL%20Joins.png)

- Favorite data science tools?
   - R studio: slow but easy to use with various features (preview document within the ID, data visualization)
   - Watson Studio: easy to collaborate with others like share document or edit code live

## Best Practices: Getting an Interview

- Never use the same resume over and over again for different companies. 
- Keep a document of all your experiences and skills and for and based on the job posting, try to find the most relevant experiences and projects to include to maximize the chance of hearing back from the company
- Networking is very important.  Because a lot of people in the industry especially, they're very willing to share their expertise in the area. And if you really show your passion, perhaps like, in the end, they would even refer to refer it to sorry, refer you to a job, or provide information about postings in their company as well.
- Reach out to the hiring manager or recruiter for a certain position 
- Cindy Huang: I applied to approximately maybe even over 100 positions, even though data science is a really has high demand nowadays, but there's also a lot of competitors. 
So, in the end, I only ended up getting around 5 interviews and fortunately IBM was one of them.
