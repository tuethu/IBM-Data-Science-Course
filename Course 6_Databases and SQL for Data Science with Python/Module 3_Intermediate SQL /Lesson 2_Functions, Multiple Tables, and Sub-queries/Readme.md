# Summary: Functions, Multiple Tables, and Sub-queries

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know: 

- Tools for database management that offer built-in functions for performing operations on data within the database itself.

- That when working with large datasets, you may save time by using built-in functions rather than first retrieving the data into your application and then executing functions on the retrieved data.

- You can use sub-queries to form more powerful queries than otherwise.

- You can use a sub-select expression to evaluate some built-in aggregate functions like the average function. 

- Derived tables or table expressions are sub-queries where the outer query uses the results of the sub-query as a data source.
