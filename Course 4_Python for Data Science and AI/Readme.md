# Summary: Python Basics

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know that: 

- Python can distinguish among data types such as integers, floats, strings, and Booleans.

- Integers are whole numbers that can be positive or negative.

- Floats are numbers that have decimal points; they can represent whole or fractional values.

- You can convert integers to floats using typecasting and vice-versa.

- You can convert integers and floats to strings.

- You can convert an integer or float to a Boolean: 0 becomes False, non-zero becomes True.

- Expressions in Python are a combination of values and operations used to produce a single result.

- Expressions perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and so on.

- We can use // to perform integer division, which results in an integer value by discarding the fractional part.  

- Python follows the order of operations (BODMAS) to perform operations with multiple expressions.

- Variables store and manipulate data, allowing you to access and modify values throughout your code.

- The assignment operator "=" assigns a value to a variable.

- Assigning another value to the same variable overrides the previous value of that variable.

- You can perform mathematical operations on variables using the same or different variables.

- Modifying the value of one variable will affect other variables only if they reference the same mutable object.  

- Python string operations involve manipulating text data using tasks such as indexing, concatenation, slicing, and formatting.

- A string is usually written within double quotes or single quotes, including letters, white space, digits, or special characters.

- A string can be assigned to a variable and is an ordered sequence of characters.

- Characters in a string identify their index numbers, which can be positive or negative.

- Strings are sequences that support operations like indexing and slicing.

- You can input a stride value to perform slicing while operating on a string.

- Operations like concatenation and replication produce new strings, while finding the length of a string returns a number.

- You cannot modify an existing string; they are immutable. 

- You can use escape sequences with a backslash (\) to change the layout of a string.  (For example, \n for a new line, \t for a tab, and \\ for a backslash, etc.)   

- In Python, you perform tasks such as searching, modifying, and formatting text data with its pre-built string methods.

- You apply a method to a string to change its value, resulting in another string. 

- You can perform actions such as changing the case of characters in a string, replacing items in a string, finding items in a string, and so on using pre-built string methods.
