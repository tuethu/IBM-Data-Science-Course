# Summary: Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

## PIE CHART
- A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, divided into segments, to illustrate numerical proportion.

- The process of creating a pie chart involves importing Matplotlib to represent a large set of data over a period of time.

## BOX PLOT
- A box plot is a way of statistically representing given data distribution through five main dimensions.

- The five main dimensions are minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

- You can create a box plot using Matplotlib.

## SCATTER PLOT

- A scatter plot displays values pertaining to typically two variables against each other.

- The process of creating a scatter plot involves importing Matplotlib to visualize a large set of data.

- Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that offers a flexible interface for creating various types of plots.

- Matplotlib’s Pyplot module offers a convenient way to create and customize plots quickly.

- Data Storytelling is the ‘art of storytelling’ that involves creating a narrative around the data.

- Data visualization is an important aspect of data storytelling and involves creating engaging visuals.
