# Summary: Basic and Specialized Visualization Tools

Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know: 

## AREA PLOT

- An area plot depicts cumulated totals using PERCENTAGES or NUMBERS over time. 

- Area plots are like a line plot but with the area below the line filled with color to emphasize the cumulative magnitude of the variables.

## HISTOGRAM

- A histogram is a way of representing the frequency distribution of a  NUMERIC dataset

- In a Histogram, the VERTICAL axis is the frequency or the number of data points in each bin.

- The first step when creating a histogram in matplotlib is to import matplotlib as mpl and its scripting interface as plt

## BAR CHART

- A BAR CHART is a type of plot where the length of each bar is proportional to the value of the item that it represents


## PIE CHART

- A pie chart is a circular statistical graphic, divided into SEGMENTS, to illustrate numerical proportion.
  
- The process of creating a pie chart involves importing Matplotlib to represent a large set of data over a period of time.

## BOX PLOT
- A box plot is a way of statistically representing given data distribution through FIVE main dimensions. These include Minimum, First quartile, Median, Third quartile, and Maximum.

- The five main dimensions are minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum.

- The first step is to import the library. You Import MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT as plt.

Careful: KIND = 'plot type', not Type = 'plot type'
DataFrame.plot.box()
DataFrame.plot(kind = ‘box’)

- The combination of function and parameter to create a box plot in Matplotlib is:
Function = plot, and Parameter = kind with value = "box" 


## SCATTER PLOT

- A scatter plot displays values pertaining to typically TWO variables against each other.

- The process of creating a scatter plot involves importing MATPLOTLIB to visualize a large set of data.


### MATPLOTLIB

- Matplotlib is a general-purpose comprehensive plotting library. Its PYPLOT module offers a convenient way to create and customize plots quickly.

- Matplotlib’s Pyplot module offers a convenient way to create and customize plots quickly.

- Data Storytelling is the ‘art of storytelling’ that involves creating a narrative around the data.

- Data visualization is an important aspect of data storytelling and involves creating engaging visuals.
