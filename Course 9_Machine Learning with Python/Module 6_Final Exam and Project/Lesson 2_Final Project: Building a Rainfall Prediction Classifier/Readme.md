## Question 1
What is the True Positive rate of the RandomForestClassifier based on the confusion matrix from Exercise 13 in the assignment notebook?
Note: The answer should be expressed as a percentage, rounded to the nearest whole number.

   - The True Positive rate of the RandomForestClassifier based on the confusion matrix from Exercise 13 is 51.1%
   - Since True Positives (TP) = 183
   - FN= False Negatives (FN) = 175
   - So, TPR = TP / (TP + FN) * 100 = 183/358 = 51.1%


## Question 2
Identify the most important feature for predicting whether it will rain based on the feature importance bar graph from the project lab.<br/>

   - Humidity3pm

## Question 3
Upload the duly completed Jupyter notebook for "Final Project : Building a Rainfall Prediction Classifier". Please ensure that you have completed all 14 coding exercises in the ipynb file before sharing the same.<br/>


## Question 4
Which of the following features would be inefficient in predicting whether it will rain tomorrow or not? (Select all that apply)<br/>

   - Evaporation
   - MaxTemp
   - WindGustDir

## Question 5
In bullets or as a numbered list, answer the following. <br/>
Comment on the accuracy of the LogisticRegression and Random Forest Classifier models.<br/>
Comment on the true positive rate of the two models.<br/>
Overall, which one of the two is a better predictor of whether it will rain tomorrow or not?<br/>

   - The accuracy of the two models is almost the same.<br/>
   - The true positive rate for Random Forest classifier and Logistic Regression Classifier is 51.1% and 50.84%<br/>
   - For Random Forest classifier: Precision: 0.75; Recall: 0.51; F1-score: 0.61<br/>
   - For The Logistic Regression Classifier: Precision: 0.68; Recall: 0.51; F1-score: 0.58<br/>
   - Therefore, the Random Forest classifier is a slightly better predictor of whether it will rain tomorrow or not.<br/>
