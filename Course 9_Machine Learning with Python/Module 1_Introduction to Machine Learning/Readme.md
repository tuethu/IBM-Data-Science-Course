# Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know that: 

- Artificial intelligence (AI) simulates human cognition, while machine learning (ML) uses algorithms and requires feature engineering to learn from data.

- Machine learning includes different types of models: supervised learning, which uses labeled data to make predictions; unsupervised learning, which finds patterns in unlabeled data; and semi-supervised learning, which trains on a small subset of labeled data.
  
- ML algorithms use computational methods to "learn" information directly from data without depending on an explicit set of instructions created by a human being.

- Key factors for choosing a machine learning technique include the type of problem to be solved, the available data, available resources, and the desired outcome.

- Machine learning techniques include anomaly detection for identifying unusual cases like fraud, classification for categorizing new data, regression for predicting continuous values, and clustering for grouping similar data points without labels.

- Machine learning tools support pipelines with modules for data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, optimization, and deployment.
  
- A machine learning engineer BUILDS PIPELINES to productionize tasks like storing, retrieving, and preprocessing data for use in machine learning model deployment.

- What are the key lifecycle stages of a machine learning model?<br/>
Define the problem, collect the data, preprocess the data, and develop, evaluate, and deploy a model.

- Sini wants to deploy a recommendation model and needs to understand the full development process. Which option best outlines the stages in the machine learning model lifecycle for Sini?<br/>
